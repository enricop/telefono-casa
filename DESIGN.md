# Telefono-Casa App

### Base usage

The application helps people living in a *Commune* to have a sense of *belonging* to that local area by gathering them as agents in a P2P network that is organized in smaller *Villages*.

People using the app may have a profile of their own house, and by discovering and voting other houses, they contribute to the creation of a P2P neighbourhood.

This network then allows people making 1-to-1 *VoIP* calls once there is a common *consensus* that they live in that village.

### Intent

Being part of a village is a choice that goes beyond the desire of belonging to a group of people, which represents only an aspect, as important as it is, of active participation in a community.

The keyword is 'community', the construction of a strong bond of trust and knowledge between families of a village.

A network of families. A sense of community.

It is an alliance that leads us to create well-being for the territory, in the perspective of a model based on the sense of co-responsibility and interdependence.

Everyone gives what they can.

Initial intent of the app is letting users know there is actually someone living near-by, and then reducing the communication distance between people of the same village.
