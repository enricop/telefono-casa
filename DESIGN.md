# Telefono-Casa App

### Intent

The application helps people living in a *Commune* to have a sense of *belonging* to that local area by gathering them as agents in a P2P network that is organized in smaller *Villages*.

Aim of the app is letting users know there is actually someone living near-by, and reducing the communication distance between people of the same village.

People using the app may have a profile of their own house, and by discovering and voting other houses, they contribute to the creation of a P2P neighbourhood.

This network then allows people making 1-to-1 *VoIP* calls once there is a common *consensus* that they live in that village.
